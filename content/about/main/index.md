  I am a Senior Research Scientist at MassBiologics of the University of Massachusetts Medical School, specializing in therapeutic antibody development for human and non-human primates. I hold a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Microbiology and Biophysics from the University of Calcutta respectively and earned my Ph.D. in Biomedical Sciences from the University of Massachusetts Medical School in 2018.

  Beyond my research, I have a passion for hiking, backpacking, and scuba diving. I also enjoy competitive gaming, particularly Counter-Strike 2 and Age of Empires II. This website serves as a platform to share insights into my work and broader interests.
